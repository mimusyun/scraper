## Assumption
    * I've made the following assumption to parse uid & job title
    - uid is always in <a> tag
    - uid always follows the format href="/en/jobs/...uid..."
    - title is always in <div> tag
    - title comes with the class 'job-card-title'
    
## Consideration
    - TDD using docker
